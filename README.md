# quotes

This is my second Flutter app created from NetNinja's [Flutter tutorial](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/flutter-beginners-tutorial).

A basic demonstration of the MVC design pattern while exploring new widgets.
All the quotes are hardcoded. Each quote can be deleted independently. The floating action button restores all the quotes to their original state.
